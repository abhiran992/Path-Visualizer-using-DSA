Path Visualizer using DSA
Overview
Path Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. The application provides a visual representation of how these algorithms navigate through a grid to find the shortest path between two points. This project is an educational tool to help users understand the underlying mechanics of pathfinding algorithms and their efficiency.

Features
Interactive Grid: Create and modify grids with walls and weights to see how algorithms handle obstacles.
Multiple Algorithms: Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the visualization to see the algorithm in action step-by-step or at a faster pace.
Responsive Design: Accessible on various devices, ensuring a consistent experience across different screen sizes.
Algorithms Implemented
Dijkstra's Algorithm: A classic algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights.
A Search*: An extension of Dijkstra's Algorithm that uses heuristics to improve performance.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): A simple algorithm suitable for unweighted grids.
Depth-First Search (DFS): A less efficient algorithm for pathfinding but useful for educational purposes.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Usage
Open the application in your web browser.
Select the algorithm you want to visualize from the options.
Create walls by clicking on the grid cells.
(Optional) Add weights by right-clicking on the grid cells.
Set the start and end points by clicking on the respective buttons and then on the grid cells.
Click on the "Start Visualization" button to see the algorithm in action.
Adjust the speed using the slider to control the pace of the visualization.
